# Bootcamp Notes:

These are notes from both sessions of the bootcamp run by Software Carpentry. 
Please edit and add suggestions so that future bootcamps will be made better and for posterity.

__Software Carpentry Workflow__
  - Proposal from Code 600 Office
  - Cost:
 
__Preparation__
  - Main Organizer should have a deputy so that there are no single points of failure.
  - Confirm room reservations and it is best to stay in the same room for the entirety of the Bootcamp (2017 - mixup in B34 that forced 40+ students into 1 room).
  - Emphasize in announcement that all attendees must have badges/access to GSFC in order to attend. No registration without access. (Do organizers need to confirm this access? Possibly impractical.)
  - Pre-Bootcamp email to all attendees needs to be sent (length?) prior to Bootcamp start stating the location, schedule, and software requirements. Confirmation of attendance is also required for this email.
  - Having a group chat to communicate during the Bootcamp is helpful (Software Carpentry used etherpad)
    - Group chat for organizers/helpers
    - Group chat for students to ask for help
  - Make sure lecturers zoom in/have very readable text from afar in their presentations and terminal environments.
  - Instruct lecturers to speak distinctly and louder so everyone can hear them even if using a microphone.
  - Video recording of lectures has been requested in the past for those that may want to review lectures and/or attend remotely. (2015 was the last year we provided this and there were some issues with it)
  - Website for information regarding the Bootcamp and link/location of registration. Software Carpentry used GitHub pages to create a single-page website that included the schedule, contact information, software requirements, and setup instructions.
  - Submit a Dateline announcement early so that it will be seen at least 3 weeks prior to the Bootcamp and up until the Wednesday before.
  - GitHub repository is good for organizing lectures and/or supplementary files, but the learning curve for students to obtain is still steep. Lectures need to be submitted for review/completion 1 week prior to Bootcamp, but especially before the email is sent to the attendees.
  - A schedule of helpers/volunteers (not only lecturers) is very helpful to ensure an evenly distribution of support. Having room leads for each room to stay and be the main coordinator for that room is very helpful, but it requires them to remain in the room for the entirety of the day (lunch break?).
  - Setup room locations 1 day prior to event (if Bootcamp starts on Monday, try to setup on Friday afternoon if there is no prior event).
  - Having extra cash to make change is good when requiring/suggesting students to contribute to offset costs of snacks.
  - Need to have survey(s) prepared for both pre- and post-bootcamp input from students.
  - Google Docs (spreadsheet) to have multiple contributors remain in contact with registrants and modify for the waiting list (Satern and Educational Office correspondance for registration).
  - Educational office contacts:
    - Code 500: melissa dot j dot cannon at nasa dot gov
    - Code 600: blanche dot w dot meeson at nasa dot gov
  - GSFC GEWA Recreational Center Contact: katryce dot l dot jackson at nasa dot gov
  - Website creation on ASD: 
  - Allowed mentors of interns to switch students that are under them only. Swapping of interns with other mentors was not allowed.
  - Software Carpentry Notes:
    - Good, but we need to make sure we obtain experienced instructors (knowledge of Python was fine).
    - Should be able to teach at a level higher than GSFC volunteer lecturers.
    - Ideally, instructors will have experience with NASA data sets. (2017 list of instructors shows many who fit this request in the US/DC area)
  - Provide sample/applicable data to use within lectures for examples/breakout sessions (freely obtainable as well).
  - Presentation and projectors need confirmation for brightness and high contrast.

__Day 1__
  - Room setup – move tables, check microphone batteries, put out snacks, take attendance, collect money, escort lecturers, put out extension cords, check microphone volume
  - Fruit (apples, oranges, pears) and water for opening
  - Coffee for break (snacks would be good)
  - Lunch announcement
  - Charged $5
  - Sign-in sheet (see photo)
  - Chips for snacks (48 count variety of Utz from Costco)
  - Setup for day 2
  - Clean up
  - Guest-cne wireless rather than nasa network.
  - Coffee stirrers (coffee (starbucks), sugar, creamer (fat & non-fat)), pastries, napkins
  - Dinner for guest speakers

__Day 2__
  - Clean up
  - Speaker volume and how speaker speaks into microphone so that there is no static / loudness that is annoying
  - Screen background should be white and text be black
  - Wireless microphones would be best so we can adjust for volume without the speaker changing distance from mouth to microphone
  - Post-bootcamp survey

__Closing__
  - Thank you email
  - Follow-up meeting and planning for next year

__Python-Specific Notes__
  - Naming temp vars in loops that are distinguishable for those that don’t have English as their primary language.

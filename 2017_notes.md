# Bootcamp Notes:

These are notes from both sessions of the bootcamp run by Software Carpentry. 
Please edit and add suggestions so that future bootcamps will be made better and for posterity.
 
__Preparation__
  - Main Organizer should have a deputy….no single points of failure…
  - Confirm room reservations (B34 mixup this year)
  - Emphasize that all attendees must have badges/access to center in order to attend the bootcamp. Don't sign up if no access. (Do organizers need to check if attendees have access? Probably impractical.) 
  - Email for coordination of schedule and required software
  - Group chat for support is nice (they used etherpad)
    - Group chat for organizers/helpers
    - Group chat for students for help
  - Make sure lecturers zoom in/have very readable text from afar
  - Talk louder so everyone can hear
  - Video recording for those that was to attend remotely?
  - Website for registration
  - Dateline announcement
  - GitHub for all files, but they need knowledge of how to obtain files
  - Extension cords from B34 sys admins
  - Schedule of helpers/volunteers
  - Setup for day 1 (possibly on Friday afternoon if there is no prior event)
  - Get change for snack money
  - Webpage with all info instead of wiki?
  - Need Room Leads to be in room all day
  - Pre-bootcamp survey
  - Lectures to be completed 1 week prior
  - Google docs for registrants (satern and educational office)
  - Educational office contacts:
    - 500 - melissa.j.cannon@nasa.gov
    - 600 - Blanche.W.Meeson@nasa.gov
  - Rec Center contact - katryce.l.jackson@nasa.gov
  - Website contact (includes registration) -
  - Dateline announcement contact -
  - Allow mentors of interns to switch students that are under them only. No swapping for interns of other mentors.
  - Email attendees prior to bootcamp to confirm attendance and give installation instructions and pre-bootcamp survey.
  - Software Carpentry Notes:
    - Good, but need to make sure we get experienced instructors.
    - Should be able to teach at a level higher than GSFC volunteers
    - Ideally, instructors will have experience w NASA data sets. (2017 list of instructors shows many who fit this request in the US/DC area)
  - Sample/applicable data to use for examples/breakout sessions
  - Presentation and projectors bright and high contrast

__Day 1__
  - Room setup – move tables, check microphone batteries, put out snacks, take attendance, collect money, escort lecturers, put out extension cords, check microphone volume
  - Fruit (apples, oranges, pears) and water for opening
  - Coffee for break (snacks would be good)
  - Lunch announcement
  - Charged $5
  - Sign-in sheet (see photo)
  - Chips for snacks (48 count variety of Utz from Costco)
  - Setup for day 2
  - Clean up
  - Guest-cne wireless rather than nasa network.
  - Coffee stirrers (coffee (starbucks), sugar, creamer (fat & non-fat)), pastries, napkins
  - Dinner for guest speakers

__Day 2__
  - Clean up
  - Speaker volume and how speaker speaks into microphone so that there is no static / loudness that is annoying
  - Screen background should be white and text be black
  - Wireless microphones would be best so we can adjust for volume without the speaker changing distance from mouth to microphone
  - Post-bootcamp survey

__Closing__
  - Thank you email
  - Follow-up meeting and planning for next year

__Python-Specific Notes__
  - Naming temp vars in loops that are distinguishable for those that don’t have English as their primary language.
